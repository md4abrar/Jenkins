# Jenkins Learning Roadmap

This repository contains a roadmap to learn Jenkins, a widely used automation server that can automate tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software. This roadmap is designed for those who are new to Jenkins or have some experience with it but want to improve their skills.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Jenkins, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of software development concepts and tools such as version control, continuous integration, and testing frameworks. Additionally, having a basic knowledge of the Java programming language can be helpful.

## Roadmap

This roadmap is divided into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level covers important concepts and tools that are essential to learn in order to become proficient with Jenkins.

### Beginner

The Beginner level covers the fundamental concepts of Jenkins and its basic features. It includes the following topics:
